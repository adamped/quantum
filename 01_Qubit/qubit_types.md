# Qubit Types

The physical representation of a qubit can come in numerous forms.

## Superconducting

These qubits are based on superconducting circuits. Superconduction occurs when the circuit has zero electrical resistance at extremely low temperatures.

The qubit in this instance is the macroscopic electrical properties of the circuit, not a particle such as an electron or photon.

They require constant cooling and are suspectible to noise, but are the easiest to manufacture and control.

## Topological

Topological qubits are based on exotic quasiparticles called non-Abelian anyons. Microsoft focuses on this approach with specific exotic quaiparticle known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs).

Topological qubits have a lot of problems to overcome in scalability but offer the potential of being less error prone.

## Trapped Ion

Ions that are trapped in electromagnetic fields, where the state of the information is encoded in the electronic state of the ion. They have the benefit of long coherence times.

## Photonic

Typically photons where the quantum information is encoded in the polarisation or path of the photon. Storing this information for long periods of time is a current challenge.
